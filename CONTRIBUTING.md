## Setting Up Your Environment
This Open Source Software can be used in a large number of environments, all of which have their own quirks and best practices. As such, while we are happy to provide documentation and assistance for unmodified Open Source Software, we cannot provide support for your specific environment.

If you can build the Telemetry SDK, you can develop it!
