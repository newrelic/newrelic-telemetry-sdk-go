# Go Telemetry SDK [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go)

What is the New Relic Go Telemetry SDK?

* It's a helper library that supports sending New Relic data from within your Go process
* Itâ€™s an example of "best practices" for sending us data

This SDK currently supports sending dimensional metrics and spans to the [Metric API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api) and [Trace API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api), respectively.


## Requirements

Go 1.13+ is required


## Get started

In order to send metrics or spans to New Relic, you will need an [Insights
Insert API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key).

To install this SDK either use `go get` or clone this repository to
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go`

```
go get -u github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go
```

Package
[telemetry](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry)
provides basic interaction with the New Relic Metric and Span HTTP APIs,
automatic harvesting on a given schedule, and handling of errors from the API
response.  It also provides the ability to aggregate individual data points into
metrics.

This example code assumes you've set the the `NEW_RELIC_INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY`
environment variable to your Insights Insert API Key.  A larger example is
provided in
[examples/server/main.go](./examples/server/main.go).

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry"
)

func main() {
	// First create a Harvester.  APIKey is the only required field.
	h, err := telemetry.NewHarvester(telemetry.ConfigAPIKey(os.Getenv("NEW_RELIC_INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY")))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	// Record Gauge, Count, and Summary metrics using RecordMetric. These
	// metrics are not aggregated.  This is useful for exporting metrics
	// recorded by another system.
	h.RecordMetric(telemetry.Gauge{
		Timestamp: time.Now(),
		Value:     1,
		Name:      "myMetric",
		Attributes: map[string]interface{}{
			"color": "purple",
		},
	})

	// Record spans using RecordSpan.
	h.RecordSpan(telemetry.Span{
		ID:          "12345",
		TraceID:     "67890",
		Name:        "purple-span",
		Timestamp:   time.Now(),
		Duration:    time.Second,
		ServiceName: "ExampleApplication",
		Attributes: map[string]interface{}{
			"color": "purple",
		},
	})

	// Aggregate individual datapoints into metrics using the
	// MetricAggregator.  You can do this in a single line:
	h.MetricAggregator().Count("myCounter", map[string]interface{}{"color": "pink"}).Increment()
	// Or keep a metric reference for fast accumulation:
	counter := h.MetricAggregator().Count("myCounter", map[string]interface{}{"color": "pink"})
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		counter.Increment()
	}

	// By default, the Harvester sends metrics and spans to the New Relic
	// backend every 5 seconds.  You can force data to be sent at any time
	// using HarvestNow.
	h.HarvestNow(context.Background())
}
```

There are 3 different types of metrics: count, summary, and gauge.  Use
[Harvester.RecordMetric](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Harvester.RecordMetric)
to record complete metrics that have already been collected. Use
[Harvester.MetricAggregator](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Harvester.MetricAggregator)
to aggregate numbers into metrics.

| Basic type | Aggregated type | Description | Example |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Gauge) | [AggregatedGauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#AggregatedGauge) | A single value at a single point in time. | Room Temperature. |
| [Count](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Count) | [AggregatedCount](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#AggregatedCount) | Track the number of occurrences of an event. | Number of errors that have occurred. |
| [Summary](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#Summary) | [AggregatedSummary](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry#AggregatedSummary) | Track count, sum, min, and max values over time. | The summarized duration of 100 HTTP requests. |

Count metrics are "delta" counts that indicate the change during the most recent
time period.  You can use the
[cumulative](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go/telemetry)
package to convert "cumulative" count values into delta values.

## Find and use your data

Tips on how to find and query your data in New Relic:
- [Find metric data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api#find-data)
- [Find trace/span data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api#view-data)
